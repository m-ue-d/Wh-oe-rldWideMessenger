# Class [Current](Current.java)

The Current class contains "runtime-variables" that may change while the app is used, such as what server you currently inspect or which direct message you are currently reading. The variables in the settings class are going to reset every time the app is restarted.

# Class [Settings](Settings.java)

The settings class contains general settings that are applied once during the program's startup with a configuration file, such as the current language, the color theme and much more. Most of these settings are customizable in the settings menu and will be automatically written to the configuration file when the app is closed.
