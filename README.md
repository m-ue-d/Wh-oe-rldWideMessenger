<h1 align=center>Wh√∂rld Wide Messenger</h1>

Welcome to our highly secure community-driven messenger service!

### üí¨ About the project

Wh√∂rld Wide Messenger is a community-driven messenger service with latest security standards in mind, written 100% in ‚òï Java / Kotlin. 

### üéØ Our mission 

We want to have the benefits of quickly writing a message to a relative, but also having a fun place to hang out with your gaming-friends. Wh√∂rld Wide Messenger is not built to focus on one specific group of people, but rather being a place for everyone to connect with each other. Because of that, high security is very important to us hence we use latest technology to keep your account and messages safe. 

Wh√∂rld Wide Messenger is available on many social media platforms such as Reddit, Twitter or even straight inside our platform for you to have a way to directly communicate with us. We are always open for changes and improvements, and if enough people vote for something they want to get changed, we will do our best to get that done. 

### ü§ù Why should I trust WWM? 

Wh√∂rld Wide Messenger is 100% open source and we don't hide a single file - everything can be looked up in the GitHub repository above. Your messages, files and images are safely stored in our secure database and cannot be inspected by any of our developers, because they are end-to-end encrypted. The same applies to your account; Your password and private decryption key are safely stored hashed + encrypted in our database and cannot be used to log into the account, even if we get compromised. 

### ‚òï Why Java? 

Java is slow, isn't it? Short answer: No, definitely not. We don't think any of these rumors are true. It's what we are familiar with and we know that Java can be insanely fast if used correctly. Java also provides a good way for cross platform deployment, we don't want that "Windows only" or "Android only" stuff - Wh√∂rld Wide Messenger is available on all platforms that are capable of running Java. This does indeed make development for a native look and feel very difficult for some platforms (we are looking at you, iOS), but either we will get it done somehow, or switch to their native development language (Swift and Objective-C in that case). 

For GUI development we chose to use Kotlin as our primary language because it provides many useful features that make building large object oriented structures a breeze. 

### üî® How it works 

The project heavily depends on the Netty Java networking library and handles basically everything that has to do with online services. From account creation to sending text messages and pictures to your friends, Netty will be the one handling all the different packets. An in-depth explanation on how Wh√∂rld Wide Messenger works can be found at the very bottom of this page.
